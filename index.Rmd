## The drake R package 

Data analysis can be slow. A round of scientific computation can take several minutes, hours, or even days to complete. After it finishes, if you update your code or data, your hard-earned results may no longer be valid. How much of that valuable output can you keep, and how much do you need to update? How much runtime must you endure all over again?

For projects in R, the `drake` package can help. It [analyzes your workflow](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html), skips steps with up-to-date results, and orchestrates the rest with [optional distributed computing](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html). At the end, `drake` provides evidence that your results match the underlying code and data, which increases your ability to trust your research.

## Installation

You can choose among different versions of `drake`. The latest CRAN release may be more convenient to install, but this manual is kept up to date with the GitHub version, so some features described here may not yet be available on CRAN.

```{r installreadme, eval = FALSE}
# Install the latest stable release from CRAN.
install.packages("drake")

# Alternatively, install the development version from GitHub.
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("ropensci/drake")
```

## Why drake?

### What gets done stays done.

Too many data science projects follow a [Sisyphean loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus):

1. Launch the code.
2. Wait while it runs.
3. Discover an issue.
4. Restart from scratch.

Ordinarily, it is hard to avoid restarting from scratch.

</center>
<br>

But with `drake`, you can automatically

1. Launch the parts that changed since last time.
2. Skip the rest.

### Reproducibility with confidence

The R community emphasizes reproducibility. Traditional themes include [scientific replicability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis), literate programming with [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/), and version control with [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). But internal consistency is important too. Reproducibility carries the promise that your output matches the code and data you say you used. With the exception of [non-default triggers](#triggers) and [hasty mode](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html#hasty-mode), `drake` strives to keep this promise.

#### Evidence

Suppose you are reviewing someone else's data analysis project for reproducibility. You scrutinize it carefully, checking that the datasets are available and the documentation is thorough. But could you re-create the results without the help of the original author? With `drake`, it is quick and easy to find out.

```{r introuptodate, eval = FALSE}
make(plan)

config <- drake_config(plan)
outdated(config)
```

With everything already up to date, you have **tangible evidence** of reproducibility. Even though you did not re-create the results, you know the results are re-creatable. They **faithfully show** what the code is producing. Given the right [package environment](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) and [system configuration](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/sessionInfo.html), you have everything you need to reproduce all the output by yourself.

#### Ease

When it comes time to actually rerun the entire project, you have much more confidence. Starting over from scratch is trivially easy.

```{r introcleanmake, eval = FALSE}
clean()       # Remove the original author's results.
make(plan) # Independently re-create the results from the code and input data.
```

#### Independent replication

With even more evidence and confidence, you can invest the time to independently replicate the original code base if necessary. Up until this point, you relied on basic `drake` functions such as `make()`, so you may not have needed to peek at any substantive author-defined code in advance. In that case, you can stay usefully ignorant as you reimplement the original author's methodology. In other words, `drake` could potentially improve the integrity of independent replication.

#### Readability and transparency

Ideally, independent observers should be able to read your code and understand it. `drake` helps in several ways.

- The [`drake` plan](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/reference/drake_plan.html) explicitly outlines the steps of the analysis, and [`vis_drake_graph()`](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/reference/vis_drake_graph.html) visualizes how those steps depend on each other.
- `drake` takes care of the parallel scheduling and high-performance computing (HPC) for you. That means the HPC code is no longer tangled up with the code that actually expresses your ideas.
- You can [generate large collections of targets](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans#large-plans) without necessarily changing your code base of imported functions, another nice separation between the concepts and the execution of your workflow

### Aggressively scale up.

Not every project can complete in a single R session on your laptop. Some projects need more speed or computing power. Some require a few local processor cores, and some need large high-performance computing systems. But parallel computing is hard. Your tables and figures depend on your analysis results, and your analyses depend on your datasets, so some tasks must finish before others even begin. `drake` knows what to do. Parallelism is implicit and automatic. See the [high-performance computing guide](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html) for all the details.

```{r scaleup, eval = FALSE}
# Use the spare cores on your local machine.
make(plan, jobs = 4)

# Or scale up to a supercomputer.
drake_batchtools_tmpl_file("slurm") # https://slurm.schedmd.com/
library(future.batchtools)
future::plan(batchtools_slurm, template = "batchtools.slurm.tmpl", workers = 100)
make(plan, parallelism = "future_lapply")
```

## Documentation

The main resources to learn `drake` are

1. The [user manual](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/), which contains a friendly introduction and several long-form tutorials.
2. The [documentation website](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/), which serves as a quicker reference.
3. [`learndrake`](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake), an R package for teaching an extended `drake` workshop. It contains notebooks, slides, Shiny apps, the latter two of which are publicly deployed. See the [README](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/blob/master/README.md) for instructions and links.
4. [`drakeplanner`](https://github.com/wlandau/drakeplanner), an R/Shiny app deployed to [wlandau.shinyapps.io/drakeplanner](https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/drakeplanner). This app is an interactive tool for creating new `drake`-powered projects. If you have trouble accessing it, you can install it as a package and run it locally.

# Similar work

`drake` enhances reproducibility and high-performance computing, but not in all respects. [Literate programming](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [local library managers](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat), [containerization](https://www.docker.com/), and [strict session managers](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) offer more robust solutions in their respective domains. And for the problems `drake` *does* solve, it stands on the shoulders of the giants that came before.

## Pipeline tools

### GNU Make

The original idea of a time-saving reproducible build system extends back at least as far as [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), which still aids the work of [data scientists](http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/15/make-for-data-scientists/) as well as the original user base of complied language programmers. In fact, the name "drake" stands for "Data Frames in R for Make". [Make](https://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) is used widely in reproducible research. Below are some examples from [Karl Broman's website](https://kbroman.org/minimal_make/).

- Bostock, Mike (2013). "A map of flowlines from NHDPlus." https://github.com/mbostock/us-rivers. Powered by the Makefile at https://github.com/mbostock/us-rivers/blob/master/Makefile.
- Broman, Karl W (2012). "Halotype Probabilities in Advanced Intercross Populations." *G3* 2(2), 199-202.Powered by the `Makefile` at https://github.com/kbroman/ailProbPaper/blob/master/Makefile.
- Broman, Karl W (2012). "Genotype Probabilities at Intermediate Generations in the Construction of Recombinant Inbred Lines." *Genetics 190(2), 403-412. Powered by the Makefile at https://github.com/kbroman/preCCProbPaper/blob/master/Makefile.
- Broman, Karl W and Kim, Sungjin and Sen, Saunak and Ane, Cecile and Payseur, Bret A (2012). "Mapping Quantitative Trait Loci onto a Phylogenetic Tree." *Genetics* 192(2), 267-279. Powered by the `Makefile` at https://github.com/kbroman/phyloQTLpaper/blob/master/Makefile.

Whereas [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is language-agnostic, `drake` is fundamentally designed for R.

- Instead of a [Makefile](https://github.com/kbroman/preCCProbPaper/blob/master/Makefile), `drake` supports an R-friendly [domain-specific language](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html#large-plans) for declaring targets.
- Targets in [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) are files, whereas targets in `drake` are arbitrary variables in memory. (`drake` does have opt-in support for files via `file_out()`, `file_in()`, and `knitr_in()`.) `drake` caches these objects in its own [storage system](https://github.com/richfitz/storr) so R users rarely have to think about output files.

### Remake

[remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) itself is no longer maintained, but its founding design goals and principles live on through [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake). In fact, [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) is a direct reimagining of [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) with enhanced scalability, reproducibility, high-performance computing, visualization, and documentation.

### Factual's Drake

[Factual's Drake](https://github.com/Factual/drake) is similar in concept, but the development effort is completely unrelated to the [drake R package](https://github.com/ropensci/drake).

### Other pipeline tools

There are [countless other successful pipeline toolkits](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline). The `drake` package distinguishes itself with its R-focused approach, Tidyverse-friendly interface, and a [thorough selection of parallel computing technologies and scheduling algorithms](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html).

## Memoization

Memoization is the strategic caching of the return values of functions. It is a lightweight approach to the core problem that `drake` and other pipeline tools are trying to solve. Every time a memoized function is called with a new set of arguments, the return value is saved for future use. Later, whenever the same function is called with the same arguments, the previous return value is salvaged, and the function call is skipped to save time. The [`memoise`](https://github.com/r-lib/memoise) package is the primary implementation of memoization in R.

Memoization saves time for small projects, but it arguably does not go far enough for large reproducible pipelines. In reality, the return value of a function depends not only on the function body and the arguments, but also on any nested functions and global variables, the dependencies of those dependencies, and so on upstream. `drake` tracks this deeper context, while [memoise](https://github.com/r-lib/memoise) does not.

## Literate programming

[Literate programming](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is the practice of narrating code in plain vernacular. The goal is to communicate the research process clearly, transparently, and reproducibly. Whereas commented code is still mostly code, literate [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) / [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) reports can become websites, presentation slides, lecture notes, serious scientific manuscripts, and even books.

### knitr and R Markdown

`drake` and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) are symbiotic. `drake`'s job is to manage large computation and orchestrate the demanding tasks of a complex data analysis pipeline. [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/)'s job is to communicate those expensive results after `drake` computes them. [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) / [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) reports are small pieces of an overarching `drake` pipeline. They should focus on communication, and they should do as little computation as possible. 

To insert a [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) report in a `drake` pipeline, use the `knitr_in()` function inside your [`drake` plan](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html), and use `loadd()` and `readd()` to refer to targets in the report itself. See an [example here](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/tree/master/main).

### workflowr

The [`workflowr`](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr) package is a project manager that focuses on literate programming, sharing over the web, file organization, and version control. Its brand of reproducibility is all about transparency, communication, and discoverability. For an example of [`workflowr`](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr) and `drake` working together, see [this machine learning project](https://2019-feature-selection.pjs-web.de/report-defoliation.html) by [Patrick Schratz](https://github.com/pat-s) ([source](https://github.com/pat-s/2019-feature-selection)).
