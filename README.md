`drake` is [superseded](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#superseded). The [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets) R package is the long-term successor of `drake`, and it is more robust and easier to use. Please visit <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/drake.html> for full context and advice on transitioning.
